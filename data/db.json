      "body": "A couple years ago, I was teaching React at a local coding bootcamp, and I noticed that there were a handful of things that kept catching students off guard. People kept falling into the same pits!In this tutorial, we're going to explore 9 of the most common gotchas. You'll learn how to steer around them, and hopefully avoid a lot of frustration.

This isn't a new idea: video games and mobile apps use sound all the time.
